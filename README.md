**Plastic Extruder Failure Analysis**

Failure analysis was performed on extrusion data using machine 
learning algorithms. The extruder consists of three independent 
units that take the raw material, which is in the form of granules, and stretch it into a plastic film by heating and pulling in three layers.

The specifications of the final product and its flaws are both under control in terms of quality. Sensors track parameters like film thickness and stretch, but the operator only sees flaws visually and not usually in real-time. Production technologists attribute these imperfections to several things, including equipment failure and subpar raw materials.

Severe problems in the extruder cause stoppages. For analysis stoppages due to failures were separated from stoppages for dimension changes. Thereafter, data were analyzed to find reasons for failures.
