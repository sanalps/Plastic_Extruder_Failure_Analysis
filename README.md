**Plastic Extruder Failure Analysis**

Failure analysis was performed on extrusion data using machine learning algorithms. The extruder consists of three independent units that take the raw material, which is in the form of granules, and stretch it into a plastic film by heating and pulling in three layers. The specifications of the final product and its flaws are both under control in terms of quality. Sensors track parameters like film thickness and stretch, but the operator only sees flaws visually and not usually in real-time. Production technologists attribute these imperfections to several things, including equipment failure and subpar raw materials.

Severe problems in the extruder cause stoppages. For analysis stoppages due to failures were separated from stoppages for dimension changes. Thereafter, data were analyzed to find reasons for failures. Failure analysis was performed on extrusion data using machine learning algorithms to reduce the number of stoppages. It was found that main cause of stoppages are due to the pressure variations in extruder B and winder changes as per RandomForest model. Light GBM model also showed that main reason for stoppages are extruder B and winding changes. Extruder B pressure variations could be due to the components proportion variation of components 1&3 which in turn may caused by pellet blower. By reducing the pressure variation of extruder B and ensuring a smooth winder change can reduce the number of stoppages of extruder.
